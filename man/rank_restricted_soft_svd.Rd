\title{Rank-Restricted Soft SVD}
\usage{
rank_restricted_soft_svd(
  X,
  r,
  lambda,
  max_iter = 100,
  tol = 1e-06,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of size \code{m x n}.}

\item{r}{An integer specifying the target rank for the low-rank approximation.}

\item{lambda}{A numeric value for the regularization parameter, controlling the shrinkage applied to the factor matrices.}

\item{max_iter}{An integer specifying the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm. Default is 100.}

\item{tol}{A numeric value for the convergence tolerance. The algorithm stops if the change in the objective
loss between iterations is less than \code{tol}. Default is \code{1e-6}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical flag indicating whether to print convergence messages during the iterations. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\item{U}{The left singular matrix of size \code{m x r}.}
\item{D}{The diagonal matrix of shrunk singular values of size \code{r x r}.}
\item{V}{The right singular matrix of size \code{n x r}.}
}
\description{
Implements the Rank-Restricted Soft Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm for low-rank approximation
with regularization, based on Algorithm 2.1 in the referenced paper.
}
\details{
The algorithm alternates between solving for the left and right singular vectors \code{U} and \code{V}, and the
singular values \code{D}, while applying a soft-thresholding operation to regularize the singular values.
The rank restriction is imposed to ensure that only the top \code{r} singular values and corresponding singular
vectors are used in the approximation.

Convergence is determined by monitoring the change in the objective loss, which includes both the reconstruction
error and the regularization term.

# Example usage:
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 50), 100, 50)
result <- rank_restricted_soft_svd(X, r = 5, lambda = 0.1)
U <- result$U
D <- result$D
V <- result$V
print(dim(U)) # Dimensions of U
print(dim(D)) # Dimensions of D
print(dim(V)) # Dimensions of V
